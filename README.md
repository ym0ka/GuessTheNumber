# GuessTheNumber (CLI)
Main objective: a console minigame in which user is asked to enter a number after another and find the random number chosen by the script.

- When the script launches, it checks a minimal config file in which I'll enter a minimum and a maximum value which the script is gonna use for its value limits.
- The script then allows the user to chose if he wants hints or not (hints WIP)
- The user enters a number
- If it is the right number, he wins
- If it's not, he loses one life, after all lives are depleted, he loses and script closes

Config values : minValue, maxValue, maxHealth
