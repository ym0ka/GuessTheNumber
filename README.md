# GuessTheNumber (CLI)
**Main objective**: a C# console minigame in which user is asked to enter a number after another and find the random number chosen by the script.

ðŸš§ Hints are still WIP.

- Chose if you want to have hints about the number chosen by the game or not
- Answer the number and see if you won
- You have a determined amount of attempts to find it, edit the config.json to change that

Config values : minValue, maxValue, maxAttempts
